# Notes

## Things I learned in this tutorial

- git fetch will update my local repo without pulling.
- git commit -am will add and commit in one command.
- licenses are important for open-source developemnt.

## Things I learned after creating my EC2 instance
- EC2 instances are the server hosting a web server and they have ips where I can access to them.
- Every time I reboot or restart my EC2 instance, its ip will change.
- To avoid this, I can create an elastic IP address and associate it with the EC2 instance.
- how to ssh into my server: ssh -i awsServer.pem ubuntu@54.224.69.77
